This is some R code I wrote in 2016, before I had any professional programming experience.
I've made no changes to it and am merely uploading it to GitHub in all of its ugly glory.
It's a stock market simulator that allows for testing various investment strategies and
comparing them against just buying at the beginning of the simulation and hanging on for
dear life.
